Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the striking clock at the north end of the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, London. The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.
