Students juggling multiple jobs is unfortunately a common occurrence within the UK; balancing studies whilst also having bills to pay in the heart of London is a strenuous task. Focusing on this aspect of their lives I held conversations with three individuals – trying to give them a space where they can express their frustrations and stresses. Through candid interviews, they share the challenges they face in managing time, feeling under-appreciated in the workplace, and navigating the complexities of student life. Themes of exhaustion, procrastination, and the struggle to find balance emerge, as they discuss the pressures of juggling academic responsibilities with demanding work schedules. As one interviewee says: “I had this mindset that I couldn’t afford to luxury to choose what type of job I wanted”.
