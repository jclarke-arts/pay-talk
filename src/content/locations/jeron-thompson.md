In this listening, I present a series of interviews taken inside and outside the retail store I work at. Each one highlights issues my colleagues face from getting to work, affording lunch and dealing with management. I explore how it feels to be “worth less than a pair of jeans.” My intention is to make it feel like a journey. You begin at work, you start thinking and evaluating all of your problems, either managerial or financial. You then leave the workplace still worrying about the same things and before you know it you are back at work repeating the cycle.
