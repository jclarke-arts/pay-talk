This personal audio essay takes you on a journey with my mother's migration. From the Philippines and Saudi Arabia to the UK, she navigated unfamiliar lands to work abroad and build a new life for our family. A journey that spans continents, sacrifices and dreams. All while adapting to new environments and still working full-time as a nurse for the NHS to support both her family living in the UK and overseas.

Through her own words, she reminisces on the struggles of displacement, the resilience of motherhood, and the meaning of home across shifting borders. For her and many Filipinos, seeking God gave her strength through the struggles of leaving home to work in foreign countries for her family. But for others, it will look entirely different.

This project highlights that every migration story is unique, but they all share common themes which are hardship, hope, and the pursuit of a better life.
