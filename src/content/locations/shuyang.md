During this interview, I spoke with three concierge staff from Arena Tower. Initially, I assumed that as frontline workers serving middle- and upper-class residents, they would struggle with low wages and financial difficulties. However, the interview results completely challenged my expectations—they were generally satisfied with their jobs. What truly burdened them was not the work itself but the high cost of living in London, including transportation, utility bills, and taxes. Therefore, through this project, I hope to raise awareness and advocate for reducing the cost of living in London, allowing more ordinary workers to afford life in this city.
