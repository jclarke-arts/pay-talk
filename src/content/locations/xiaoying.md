This video surveyed three staff members from different art galleries, listening to their views on their work, the problems they encountered in their work, and the areas they hoped to improve.

My concept is to show the current situation of this industry by investigating three different art galleries, discussing with employees working there and listening to their views and opinions on their work. Include their salary, the problems they encountered on the job, positive or negative facts.
