According to the Youth UK website, 81% of young people in the workforce feel undervalued, 78% feel patronised, and 75% feel they have been outright rejected from a job based on their age. Meanwhile, 49% of young adults feel they cannot progress in their careers.

You are going to hear from 7 employed or previously employed individuals all under the age of 25 in discussions about their jobs. All have faced adversities in their fields and hope to shed light on the issues faced by young adults in the workforce today.
