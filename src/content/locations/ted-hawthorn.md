Füruğ and Harry both work similar jobs and share social groups - a community formed by their involvement in central London's back of house retail environment. Coming from contrasting backgrounds, this audio piece seeks to explore the differences in their journey to the inner city, comparing immigration to internal migration.

Both sharing a keen interest in the arts and London's expansive creative scene, my aim is to document the challenges of accessing this society and what actions can be taken to enhance involvement whilst still earning a living. Through a loose, conversational interview structure, subtle nuances of their environments are brought to light. Stories and aspirations are shared, alongside opinions and overviews of how to bridge social, creative and working gaps.
