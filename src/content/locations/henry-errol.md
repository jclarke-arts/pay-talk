It's a rainy night in Deptford and I'm sitting in Jars having a conversation with Errol about the changes he has experienced in his community. Errol was born and raised in SE8 and still resides here today. We discussed topics such as hospitality, housing, gentrification and the effects of COVID. He offered a unique perspective into the area as there has been tremendous amounts of change to his home over the past few years. Whether these changes have been good for the community are debatable.
