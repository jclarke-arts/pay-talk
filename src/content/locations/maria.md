London is Burning, a 15-minute DJ set by Pixel Girl, looks into the critical issue of pay within the music industry. Alongside the voices of UAL students and musicians Rosie, Jenny, and Jack, the set explores the personal, professional, and political impacts of financial inequality in the music world of the 21st century. Paired with a lecture by Mark Fisher, the piece brings clarity to the topics of discussion. Through this fusion of interviewing and DJing, a conversation about the issues surrounding pay, or lack thereof within the music industry is shared.
