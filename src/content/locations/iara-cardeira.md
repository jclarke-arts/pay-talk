In this audio piece, I speak with a 16-year-old kitchen porter at a busy restaurant in East Dulwich. He reflects on what it’s like to enter the workforce at such a young age, particularly in an entry-level role, and shares how his initial optimism has been tempered by the reality of low pay and unfulfilled promises. Despite the high demands of the job, he is currently paid the minimum rate of £6.40 per hour— the lowest wage band for under 18s in the UK— and was assured he would earn more once his training finished. Although he has now completed that training, the promised pay rise has yet to materialise, leaving him feeling undervalued and questioning the fairness of the system.
