Self-sufficient refers to a person relying on their own labor to obtain the necessities of life in order to survive, rather than relying on the economic support of others. Self-sufficient means economic independence, and being able to support oneself is an important criterion for judging whether a person has truly grown into an adult.

In traditional Chinese beliefs, getting something for nothing is shameful, so it is shameful to still rely on one's parents' income to live after adulthood. Moreover, the behavior of ‘sponge off one's parents’ will also be criticized by others.

However, supporting oneself is not an easy task, especially for young people who are just entering society, it is a process from 0 to 1. In order to better answer the question of ‘how to become a self-sufficient person’, I conducted a series of interviews.
