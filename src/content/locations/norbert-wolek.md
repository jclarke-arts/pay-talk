Underneath the idyllic portrayals of British canals as one of the last bastions of the bohemian lifestyle, there lies a hidden narrative of struggle, endurance and a constant uphill battle with authority spanning over decades. This project explores challenges faced by boaters living on the canal, drawing a connection between employment, housing and the cost of living crisis, in addition to highlighting some of the problems regarding the legislation surrounding this alternative mode of living.
