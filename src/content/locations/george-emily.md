I spoke with Emily about working through the nights as a Psychiatric Liason Nurse at St. Thomas' Hospital in Accident & Emergency, and on a psychiatric ward. She discussed; her perspective on the mental toll of the graveyard shift in a high-stress envionment; mistreatment through physical and emotional abuse; lunar superstitions that float through the acute medical ward; and just getting on with it.

After work, she's greeted by the familiar hum of the N453.
