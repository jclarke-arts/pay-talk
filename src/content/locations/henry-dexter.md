Me and Dexter are walking from his studio in Creekside to the shop when we started talking about his life as an artist. Dexter grew up in Lewisham and has lived all over the world, but currently he lives in Deptford. We touch on topics such as his influences, how he positions himself as an artist and pay. His unique perspective offers a comparison of the art industry between London and the rest of the world.
