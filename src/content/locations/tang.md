As we sit in a cozy cafe near Soho, Menghan shares her unique approach to art therapy, which combines traditional Chinese fortune-telling with creative expression. As an art therapist based in London, she tells me about her journey and how she incorporates fortune-telling to help people heal their psychological wounds. We discuss the challenges she faces in a culture where Western psychology dominates the therapy landscape and the skepticism she often encounters. Her work blends ancient wisdom with modern healing techniques, offering a new perspective on mental health that goes beyond traditional methods.
