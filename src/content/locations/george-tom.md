I spoke with Tom about working the night shift in a hostel called Palmers Lodge. He discussed sitting with silence, spending hours a night trying to stay at a low level of engagement, and his separation from 'normal' living. He delves into social isolation and talks about methods he's come up with for avoiding it as much as his schedule allows.

But on the bus, no one talks; everyone is tired.
