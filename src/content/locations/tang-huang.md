Me and Huang Ziyue are sitting in her studio in central London when she starts talking about her experience as an artist in the UK. Originally from China, Huang has spent one year in London as an artist in residence. She reflects on the challenges she faced, particularly the pressures within the highly competitive art residency program. We discuss the difficulties of navigating her cultural background in the UK art scene, the gender dynamics in her field, and her personal health struggles. Her insights shed light on the pressures of being an artist in London, and how she tries to find a balance between her career and well-being.
