Jordan is a doctor working in both the emergency and acute medical departments of Homerton Hospital in East London. In this conversation, she touches on the difficulties inherent from working unsocial hours in a high-stress environment.

She discusses the lack of community support available to night workers and the resultant impact that it can have on both their mental and physical health. Over time, separation from ‘normal’ routines disjoints individuals from those who surround them. The only company left is the hum of the bus, and the shared silence of others on their way back from a long night.
