Iâ€™m walking with Yuhan through a quiet street near Soho when she opens up about her career as an artist and entrepreneur. Having gained recognition in China for her digital art, Yuhan faced a painful experience when her work was plagiarized and she became the target of online attacks. Now, living in the UK, she talks about the challenges of starting a new business and the difficulties of being taken seriously as a Chinese entrepreneur. We dive into her thoughts on intellectual property, the importance of blockchain for artists, and her hopes for greater support for immigrant artists. Her story is one of resilience, turning a negative experience into a fresh start in a new country.
