A classic London common with plenty of open green space, perfect for long summer evenings with a big group of friends. Further inside you can find a gated park containing a well-maintained ornamental garden; green-thumb's may enjoy the Tree Trail produced by Friends of the Park, available at peckhamryepark.org.
